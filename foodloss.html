<p><strong>India’s Food Paradox: Scarcity and the Crisis of Food Loss</strong></p>
<p>Vasanth Kumar</p>
<p>With India having overtaken China as the world’s most populous country two years ago, we are left to ponder the ramifications of our country’s achievement.  One aspect of this conundrum is the challenge of meeting the demand of resources, especially food.  Not too long ago, the rhetoric in public conversations about population was often tainted by the population bomb thesis. It is good to notice more nuanced discussions taking place today. However, while these discussions cite issues of food security, they often do not delve into the question of whether we have sufficient food in the first place. While we have a hungry populace, the focus is on increasing food production, yet there is little consideration of what is happening to the current produce.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to dismiss the criticisms raised by the <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1967164">government</a> and <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/revisiting-indias-hunger-index-conundrum-3302362">commentators</a> (Gurucharan Gollerkeri, Deccan Herald, December 4, 2024) on the methodology and data used by the Global Hunger Index, the World Food Programme - an organization within the United Nations mentions that despite steady economic growth and self-sufficiency in grain production, <em><a href="https://www.wfp.org/countries/india">“high levels of poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition persist”</a></em>. </p>
<p>Beyond measurement debates, India’s food loss crisis reveals deeper systemic gaps. Research on food loss and waste in India is still in its nascent stage and estimates differ on the level of Food Loss and Waste (FLW). For example, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering and Technology (ICAR-CIPHET),  at the behest of the government conducted a study in 2016 that proposes a conservative estimate stating that FLW is negligible. In 2022, a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359814200_Supply-side_Problems_in_Food_Loss_and_Waste_Issues_in_Mitigation_through_Cold_Chain">study</a> published in the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW) by Nuthalapati Dev and Sharma challenged the ICAR-CIPHET&#39;s estimate of FLW and also sought to build an alternative estimate. The EPW study asserted that the former study not only had methodological errors but also pointed out that its estimates were not corroborated by other studies, including a government study by the Small Farmers’ Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC). Further, the EPW&#39;s estimates matched with SFAC conclusions, revealing far greater losses occurring mid-supply chain. A <a href="https://wri-india.org/sites/default/files/Food%20Losss%20and%20Waste_August%202021.pdf">working paper</a> by the World Resources Institute in 2021 also highlighted how the differences in measurement metrics in different surveys pose a challenge to compare the estimates. The NABARD Consultancy Service Pvt. Ltd (<a href="https://www.mofpi.gov.in/sites/default/files/study_report_of_post_harvest_losses.pdf">NABCONS</a>) also published an estimate in 2022 which seems to have the latest <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1885038">data</a> on the issue. </p>
<p>Although there is no exact clarity and accuracy on the numbers and specifics of FLW as of now because it has not been extensively researched, there are some aspects that are common throughout.  Fruits and vegetables have high percentages of FLW. Pulses, poultry, eggs, oilseeds, marine fish are other crops and commodities that have significant amounts of FLW. Also, the number for cereals (rice, wheat, etc.) is noticeably lower than the above mentioned foods. A <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08951-8">study</a> in 2020 compared the Indian diet with a reference diet from EAT-Lancet and concluded, <em>&quot;Indian diets, across states and income groups, are unhealthy. Indians also consume excess amounts of cereals and not enough proteins, fruits, and vegetables&quot;</em>  This suggests that we are losing out on what we need the most.</p>
<p>According to NABCONS 2022, lack of proper storage conditions and improper handling contributed majorly towards post-harvest losses in fruits and vegetables. Other studies also note that cold storages are not widespread and are largely used by endowed farmers who are into export businesses. All the studies urge the need for establishing and upgrading a network of cold storage facilities from farm to table. </p>
<p>The government has come up with a number of <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1910360">incentives</a> to encourage the expansion of cold storages such as tax holidays, FDIs up to 100%, lowering of GST and it has also incorporated storage-related incentives and assistance in its various <a href="https://groundreport.in/agriculture/post-harvest-losses-in-india-6803653">schemes</a>. However, only time will tell whether these efforts will prevent our precarious future from rotting or not. </p>
<p>FLW hurts everyone - consumers pay more, hunger isn’t quenched, farmers lose income and carbon footprint also increases which adds to climate change. Despite the lack of uniform consensus on the specific numbers, we know that there is a significant amount of FLW happening especially for fruits and vegetables.  To ensure that our populace is well fed with nutritious food, it is vital to reduce FLW as much as possible. While government reports are picking up on the need to reduce FLW rather than simply increasing production, there is a need for a wider understanding of this problem and extensive research must be conducted to find the exact numbers so that we can take appropriate policy actions.</p>
