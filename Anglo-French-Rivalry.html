<p>The Anglo-French Rivalry also known as the Carnatic Wars refer to the conflict between the French East India Company (FEIC) and the English East India Company (EEIC) from 1744 to 1764. These wars were fought between the two companies for the monopolistic control of the Indo-European trade. To secure their commercial interests it was necessary for the Europeans to maintain political control over Indian territories.</p>
<p>The EEIC and FEIC were the only two European companies that had significant presence over the subcontinent in the 18th Century. The Portuguese had given the island of Bombay as dowry for King Charles the II of English when he married a Portuguese princess and eventually the Portuguese lost all their possessions in India except Goa, Diu and Daman. The Dutch who had hitherto fought the English, gave up claims to English possessions in India as the latter did the same to Dutch possessions in Indonesia.</p>
<p>The English had learnt a bitter lesson when they tried to challenge the Mughal empire at their zenith in 1686. Following the disastrous war between the two, the English were humbled and asked to be pardoned. While the Mughals in the north, Nawabs in Bengal and Marathas in the west disallowed for foreign penetration, the Carnatic South had no such strong power, which provided foreigners an opportunity to expand their political influence. </p>
<p>The British established Fort St. George in Madras which was their centre of activity in the south. The French had several trading posts in various ports but were firmly established at Chandernagore in Bengal and Pondicherry in the South, with the latter being fortified. </p>
<p>The First Carnatic War broke out mirroring the Anglo-French hostiles in Europe on the issue of Austrian succession in 1740. Following the French seizure of Madras, the English appealed to Anwarudin, the Nawab of Carnatic whose large forces were defeated by a small French army in the Battle of St. Thome. This was an eye-opener for the British regarding the military capability of Indian rulers. However, as per the treaty signed at the end of the Austrian war of succession, the French had to return Madras to get their territories in North America handed back to them. </p>
<p>Dupleix, the French governor-general who had led the first Carnatic War had discovered another opportunity to express his shrewdness. He realized that there was a claimant to the throne of Anwaruddin called Chanda Sahib. He also exploited a similar situation in Hyderabad, where he supported one claimant, Muzaffar Jung over another. The combined alliance attacked Anwaruddin, killed him in the Battle of Ambur and Chanda Sahib became the Nawab of Carnatic. </p>
<p>The new Nawab generously rewarded his French friends with 80 villages around Pondicherry. The son of Anwaruddin, Muhammed Ali fled to the Trichinopoly which was under British control. In Hyderabad too, following the enthroning of French allies, the French were not only heavily rewarded in money and territory but also ensured their control over these client rulers. Chanda Sahib not only failed to retake his capital but also surrendered and subsequently killed. By this shrewd strategy of using a disciplined French force to intervene in the quarrels of Indian princes, the FEIC would secure monetary support and territorial grants (several jagirs). </p>
<p>However, the glory of the French would come to an end when the English began supporting the princes whom the French had helped oust. The English forces led by the able Robert Clive accomplished a feat of occupying the capital of Carnatic, Arcot with a mere army of 500 men. As the French rushed to save the Carnatic capital, they had to bring their soldiers from Trichinopoly thereby relieving Ali.   </p>
<p>The French government, weary about the expense of wars and fear of loss of their American possessions, initiated peace negotiations and agreed to the English demand of recalling Dupleix in 1754. Muhammed Ali met the same fate as the Indian princes who befriended the French, though placed on the throne he was still dependent on his European ally. </p>
<p>In 1756, the Seven Years War broke out between the English and the French and this time the French received a decisive final blow to their dreams of controlling India. The French were inflicted with heavy losses and their holds fell one after another. In the Battle of Wandiwash (1760) Eyre Coot decisively defeated Count de Lally and following a few months, Pondicherry would be seized by the British. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763, as per which, the French factories were restored but could not be fortified and thus the French were effectively under British protection in India. </p>
<p>FEIC was heavily dependent on their incompetent and ineffective home government for taking decisions. Whereas, the Charter Acts gave the EEIC the right to wage war and sign treaties. Further, the EEIC was able to also collect revenue from Bengal where they were zamindars of the Nawabs unlike the French who were so bankrupt that they hadn’t paid the salary of their soldiers in months.  Several more reasons explain the British victory such as their naval superiority. </p>
<p>The Carnatic Nawab paid for the English campaigns against the French and following his death, the Carnatic was annexed. The Hyderabadi Nizam by becoming dependent on the British, more or less lost his sovereignty.  The victory of the English in the Carnatic wars made the English the sole European power to gain mastery over the Indian subcontinent.</p>
