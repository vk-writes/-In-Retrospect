<p>I am a History &amp; Economics major with a focus on research, writing, and critical analysis across interdisciplinary contexts. Broadly interested in qualitative research, archival work, heritage conservation, and public humanities.</p>
<p>This website exists to host my writing. I made this website using AI. Although I only have a basic understanding of Java, that was sufficient for me to be able to have a fundamental understanding of programming in general. </p>
<p>I made Chat GPT and Deepseek write all the code(CSS, JS, Python) and through manual oversight, customized prompting, and multiple rounds of iterative debugging, I was able to finally get it running. </p>
<p>I made this website as a fun project to use AI in a productive and helpful manner.</p>
